            <br>Now a days cancellation and rebooking of tickets may cost in many service
            charges which causes a lot of inconvenience (regarding money) <br>to the users .Not
            only this but also when there is an emergency issue occurs while travelling in the
            train (like criminal offences and <br>medical emergency),they cant reach the officials
            or get the required help immediately.<br>They can only rectify their problem only after
            reaching their destination/next station.
            <br>
            By this project we are trying to overcome the above mentioned issues.
            <br>
            ---> To overcome the cancellation and rebooking issue we have added a
            new feature named "Shift_Tickets".<br>This feature helps us to shift our
            tickets to another required date of journey if tickets are available for<br>
            that day or else we can cancel the tickets.This helps the user by
            applying minimum charges.
            <br>
            ---> To overcome the emergency issues we are providing a feature
            named "Complaint" which includes <br>both Reservation as well as
            Emergency sections.When there is an emergency , user/traveller
            can mention <br>their issues in the emergency section which will reach
            the officials in time and can send the required<br>support to the next
            possible station itself.This will help travellers for a safe and
            comfortable journey.</p>
